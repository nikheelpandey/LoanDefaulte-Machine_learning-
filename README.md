# LoanDefaulte-Machine_learning


This my approach to point out the loan defaulters in the data provided from hackerearth.com
I got an accuracy of 90% without even doing much of feature engg. The project is ongoing as I am trying to attain atleast an accuracy of 95%. 


This is not the final ipynb as I would like to first get an accuracy of 90+ and then would document it soon. This file got 90.20% score unto submission as in the end I used weigted average of all the predictors. I am currently experimenting with the cross validation. Any help regarding the improvement is very welcomed!
